# Middleman::S3Redirect

AWS S3 allows redirects to occur directly from an S3 object. This gem
automates configuring AWS S3 to redirect from one path to another.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'middleman-s3_redirect'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install middleman-s3_sync

## Usage

You need to add the following code to your ```config.rb``` file:

```ruby
activate :s3_redirect do |config|
  config.bucket                = 'my.bucket.com' # The name of the S3 bucket you are targetting. This is globally unique.
  config.region                = 'us-west-1'     # The AWS region for your bucket.
  config.aws_access_key_id     = 'AWS KEY ID'
  config.aws_secret_access_key = 'AWS SECRET KEY'
  config.after_build           = false # We chain after the build step by default. This may not be your desired behavior...
end
```

The ```redirect``` method register a redirect:

```ruby
redirect '/old/path', '/new/path'
```

You can then configure S3 to redirect these path by running  ```middleman s3_redirect```.

## AWS Authentication

There are a few ways to provide the credentials to s3_redirect. They
are:

* Add a .s3_sync file at the root of the project.
* Pass credentials via environment variables
* Enter them directly into the config.rb file.

### Credentials in .s3_sync file

### Credentials Via Environment

### Credentials in config.rb

## A Debt of Gratitude

I used Middleman Sync as a template for building a Middleman extension.
The code is well structured and easy to understand and it was easy to
extend it to add my synchronization code. My gratitude goes to @karlfreeman
and is work on Middleman sync.

Many thanks to [Junya Ogura](https://github.com/juno) for multiple pull
requests improving this gem.
